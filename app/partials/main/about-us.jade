		h1 About Us
		p Renting an apartment is a chaotic experience.
		p Tenants have to contend with fraud, spam, unresponsive landlords, bait-and-switch tactics, unavailable apartments, and much more.
		p We believe that the biggest problem is good, accurate, reliable data about apartments: what’s actually on the rental market, for how much, for how long, where, and with what amenities.
		p We know that tenants want the full, accurate picture: everything that’s really available, with as much information about each apartment as possible. That’s why we’re building Untitler—a comprehensive, accurate, up-to-date apartment search platform—to end the chaos of renting apartments. We’re been launched since late 2012, primarily in New York, but are experimenting with how we can best help tenants throughout the country.
